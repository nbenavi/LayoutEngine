Platform:Mobile

## Mesh Types

The list below shows all of the mesh types supported on mobile platforms. **No other types of mesh are supported.**

* [Skeletal Meshes](Engine/Content/Types/SkeletalMeshes)
* [Static Meshes](Engine/Content/Types/StaticMeshes)
* [Landscape](Engine/Landscape)
* [CPU particle sprites, particle meshes](Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems)

The [import process](Engine/Content/FBX) or asset creation process is the same for these types on mobile as it is 
for other platforms.

## Mesh Limitations

There are certain restrictions on the mesh types supported on mobile platforms due to the hardware.

* All mesh types can have up to 65k vertices due to the lack of 32 bit index support on mobile hardware.
* Skeletal Meshes can have up to 75 bones.
