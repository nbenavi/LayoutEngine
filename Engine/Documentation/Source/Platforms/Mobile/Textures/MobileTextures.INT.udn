## Overview

Since mobile platforms use OpenGL ES2, there are restrictions imposed on textures. Some of the restrictions come into play 
when creating textures:

* A maximum size of 2048 in either dimension. This is the largest size allowed by the PVR compressor.
* Dimensions must both be a power of 2 (i.e. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048).
* You should use square textures whenever possible as they make more efficient use of memory. <!-- Non-square textures are padded out to be square. (?)  -->

In addition, texture settings need to be set up properly to work on mobile platforms:

* Only TC_Default or TC_NormalMap (and TC_Greyscale?) values are used in the **Compression Settings**.
* The **sRGB** property should be enabled.
 
## Texture Usage in Materials

Most opaque Materials should only need BaseColor, Roughness, and Normal to come from textures. Specular should not be specified 
and Metallic can be a constant. Given that base set of Material properties, most Materials that only have one layer should use 
the following setup which only requires two textures:

* **Texture 1**
	* BaseColor in RGB
	* Roughness in alpha
	* TC_Default compression
* **Texture 2**
	* Normal map in RGB
	* TC_NormalMap compression

Additional layers will need to use more textures, with the option of only layering in BaseColor + Roughness to avoid multiple normal map texture fetches.
