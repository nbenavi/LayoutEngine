Description:Overview of the SceneCaptureCube class

[EXCERPT:ASceneCaptureCube]

Scene Capture Cubes capture a fully dynamic cube map from their location on every frame. This requires a Cubemap Render Target to actually capture to, and then that Render Target can be used as a texture within any Material.
