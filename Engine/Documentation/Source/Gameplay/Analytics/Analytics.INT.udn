## Overview
In order to get data on how your game is performing, you must use an analytics provider to capture and process the data. For those without a homegrown solution, there are plenty of 
options available, from free services to paid ones. Unreal Engine provides an abstract interface for communicating with one or more analytics providers. Your game uses the interface, 
and analytics providers offer a backing implementation. In some cases, Epic has built the backing provider already. Before version 4.5, Epic provided an implementation to multicast analytics
events, relaying them to multiple providers. For providers, there is support of providers that support [Swrve](http://www.swrve.com), a paid service. Unreal Engine 4.5 and later provides
support for [Apsalar](http://www.apsalar.com), a free service on iOS, and a file based system primarily used for debugging. More provider plugins will become 
available over time, and it is also feasible to add your own provider if needed. 

## Instrumenting Your Game
The first step in capturing player retention data is to register an analytics provider for your game. This is done via your project's `DefaultEngine.ini` file. You must register a 
default provider. Optionally, you can register different providers and account details for different build types of your game (development, testing, and production). The sections below 
are an example of configuring the Apsalar plugin:

	[Analytics]
	ProviderModuleName=IOSApsalar
	ApiKey=YourAnalyticsKey1
	ApiSecret=YourAnalyticsSecret1
	SendInterval=60

	[AnalyticsDevelopment]
	ApiKey=YourAnalyticsKey2
	ApiSecret=YourAnalyticsSecret2
	SendInterval=60

	[AnalyticsTest]
	ApiKey=YourAnalyticsKey3
	ApiSecret=YourAnalyticsSecret4
	SendInterval=60

The `[Analytics]` section is the default one used and is where you should set the name of the default provider module. In the case above, it is set to the IOSApsalar plugin that is part 
of the 4.5 release. The `ApiKey` and `ApiSecret` fields come from the Apsalar website. Once you create an account, they will give you a key and secret to use.

Once you have it configured for your project, you are ready to start recording analytics events. To get just the basic player retention data, you need to create a session when the 
game starts up and end it when it is no longer in the foreground. This can be done using the lines of code shown below, or the [Blueprint analytics plugin](Gameplay/Analytics/Blueprints)
provided in versions 4.5 and later:

	FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->StartSession();
	FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->EndSession();

With those calls as part of your game, you will automatically start gathering player retention data. After getting basic player retention data, you can start adding more events to 
tell you even more about player behavior in your game.
