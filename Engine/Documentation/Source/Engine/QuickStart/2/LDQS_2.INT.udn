Next, create a new level to build your game environment in. When creating a new level, just as when you created a new project, 
Unreal Engine enables you to select from _templates_. By default, there is a _Default_ template - which has a very simple environment - 
and an _Empty Level_ template - which is completely blank - to choose from.

Let's get started creating a new level:

1. From the File menu of the **Level Editor** window, choose ![](Engine/QuickStart/3/new_button.png) **New Level...**. This will display the **New Level** dialog:

1. For the purposes of this guide, you need a completely blank slate to work with. Click on the **Empty Level** template to select it.

1. The new blank level will be ready for you to populate with all the visual and gameplay related items you desire.
