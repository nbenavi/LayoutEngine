With a number of Actors placed, it is time to edit a few of them. With the first being the **Directional Light Actor**.

1. Select the **Directional Light Actor** by **Left-clicking** on it in the Viewport.

1. In the **Details Panel** under the **Light** category, enable **Used as Atmosphere Sun Light**:

	Depending on the rotation of your **Directional Light Actor** the sky color will change, and if you rotate the Viewport around you will see that the sun now aligns with the **Directional Light Actor**. This is a real time process so you can rotate the **Directional Light Actor** (press **E** to switch to **Rotation Mode**) and the sky will change color from night, sunrise, day time, and sunset.

Now change the **Material** on one of your placed **Static Mesh Actors** by first selecting it. 

1. With your Actor selected, in the **Details** panel under **Materials**, click the drop-down box under **Element 0**.
