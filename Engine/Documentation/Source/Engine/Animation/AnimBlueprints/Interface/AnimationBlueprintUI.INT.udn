## Viewport
The viewport displays the Skeletal Mesh with any animations activated by current variable values.

![](AnimGraphUI_Viewport.png)

## Class Defaults

The **Class Defaults** panel displays all of your Animation Blueprint's variables, in their assigned categories. You can manually modify the variable values here to preview and test different animations in the viewport.

![](AnimGraphUI_BPDefaults.png)

For more information, see [](Engine/Animation/Persona\BlueprintDefaults).

## Graph

The tabbed graph panel displays whichever graph is currently selected.

### EventGraph Tab

The **EventGraph** tab contains any animation event nodes that trigger the updates of the Skeletal Mesh poses.  It can also contain animation nodes that set variable values that determine which animation asset is played when.

![](AnimGraphUI_Graph.png)(w:900)

### AnimGraph Tab

The **AnimGraph** tab contains the State Machine that hooks up all the actual animations and States, along with any other animation nodes you want.

![](AnimGraphUI_AnimGraph.png)

For more information about State Machines, see [](Engine/Animation/StateMachines).

[REGION:note]
Although you could put all your animation nodes directly into the **AnimGraph** tab, it is more efficient to organize them into a State Machine, States, and Transitions (Rules), for ease of upkeep and simplicity.

## Asset Browser Tab

The **Asset Browser** tab contains a list of all the animation assets in your Animation Blueprint.

![](AnimGraphUI_AssetBrowser.png)

## My Blueprint Tab

The **My Blueprint** tab contains a list of all the graphs and variables in your Animation Blueprint.

![](AnimGraphUI_MyBP.png)

By default, you can find the **My Blueprint** tab next to the **Asset Browser** tab, underneath the graph.


## Details Panel

The **Details** panel displays the properties of selected elements.

![](AnimGraphUI_Details.png)

## Palette

The **Palette** panel contains all the nodes available for use in the Animation Blueprint's various graphs.

![](AnimGraphUI_Palette.png)
