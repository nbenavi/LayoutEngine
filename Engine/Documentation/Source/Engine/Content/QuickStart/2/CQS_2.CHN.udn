## Content File Types

Almost every game will use content created externally to Unreal Engine 4. Given this, the editor supports importing a number of file formats for 3D, 2D, audio, and animation assets. For the purposes of this quick start guide, we will be focusing on 3D and 2D assets, specifically **Static Meshes** and **Textures**.

	[PARAM:icon]
		![](FBX_Icon.png)(w:218 convert:false)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:description]
	[INCLUDE:Engine/Content/FBX#intro]

	In Unreal Engine 4, the FBX format is used for **Static Meshes**, **Skeletal Meshes**, and **Animation Sequences**.

	For more information on the FBX pipeline see: [**%Engine/Content/FBX:title%**](Engine/Content/FBX).

	Image Files

		![](ImagesIcon.png)(w:218 convert:false)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:description]
	Image files imported into Unreal Engine 4 are primarily used in **Materials**, but can also be used in the Landscape Editor and various paint tools as height maps or paint brush masks. In some cases, they can be applied directly to the HUD.

	Some formats have very specific uses. The file types of .hdr and some formats of .dds are used for **Cubemaps** while .raw files can be imported as a height map into the Landscape Editor.

	For more information on supported image types, see: [**%Engine/Content/Types/Textures/Importing:title%**](Engine/Content/Types/Textures/Importing).

In the next step, we will be going over the import of a few files, including an FBX file and a few images to be used in a material.
