Welcome to SpeedTree for Unreal Engine 4. The pages in this section detail how to use the SpeedTree tools and models to their maximum effect in your Unreal Engine 4 application. The techniques shown here apply to both custom and subscription licensees.

## How Does It Work?

Using SpeedTree with UE4 is a three step process:

* **Create or purchase a SpeedTree model**. Whether you use models from the [SpeedTree library](http://www.speedtree.com/ue4/ue4trees.php) or create one from scratch using the SpeedTree Modeler, you will need a model to get started. Models consist of the SpeedTree files (.spm, .srt) and the textures and component meshes (.obj, .fbx) associated with it. Click [here](http://docs.speedtree.com/doku.php?id=gettingstarted) to learn more about creating models in SpeedTree.

* **Import the model into UE4**. SpeedTree models are imported into UE4 like any other asset. They come in as a Static Mesh with extra vertex attributes to implement wind and smooth LOD. You can do anything with them that you can do with a Static Mesh inside of UE4. Click [here](Engine/Content/SpeedTree/ImportingModelsIntoUE4) to learn more about import SpeedTree models into UE4.

* **Place models in your scene.** Once imported, SpeedTree models can be placed or painted like any other Static Mesh. Click [here](Engine/Content/SpeedTree/WorkingWithModelsinUE4) to learn more about placing SpeedTree models in UE4.
