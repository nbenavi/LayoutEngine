Title:Composite Texture
Crumbs:
Description:

The **Composite Texture** feature provides the ability to combine one _Texture_ with the content of another.

This is currently used to adjust the roughness of one _Texture_ with the normal map details of another.
This is useful for fighting a common artifact in real-time 3d rendering: Aliasing or shimmering of normal
maps in the distance. It also maintains the specular size for a _Material_ whose normal map is detailed
when near to the camera, but uses the mip maps of the normalmap that might appear flat when farther away.

## Setting up the Composite Texture to Modify the Roughness Depending on Normalmap Details

To configure a _Texture_ to use the **Composite Texture**, assign the normal map (same size or higher res) to 
the **Composite Texture** property in your diffuse _Texture_. We often store the roughness in the diffuse alpha
channel, but you can adjust any channel by changing the default settings. 

The process assumes the _Texture_ already contained a roughness value and adjusts the channel depending on the 
variation in the normal map to a rougher value (brighter).

[REGION:tip]
If the _Texture_ does not already contain info in the alpha channel, the process of modifying that particular 
channel will not work as no alpha channel means white. Instead, you must first adjust the **Max Alpha** property 
to set the source alpha to a constant value. If you directly hook up the alpha channel of the texture to the material
roughness and your alpha channel was white (1, which is the default), then you can directly specify the roughness value
as **Max Alpha**. The adjustment will be done to the texture content. The roughness adjustment will be done on top of that.

You can set the **Texture Editor** to only show the alpha channel to verify your adjustments.

### Compositing Properties

There are some additional properties that affect how the **Composite Texture** modifies the _Texture_'s channel.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Composite Texture Mode | Specifies which channel of the _Texture_ (_R_, _G_, _B_, or _A_) the **Composite Texture** is used to modify. |
| Composite Power | Determines how much influence the **Composite Texture** has on the target channel. [1:default, <1 less influence, >1 more influence] |

## Using the Composited Roughness Map

The _Material_ makes use of the roughness map by sampling the alpha channel of the _Texture_.

You can combine multiple roughness in the shader by adding them and they should combine naturally.

## Issues

This feature only works if the UV layout of your normal map and the roughness map is the same.
Note that this approximates the correct result. The result is isotropic, meaning any directionality of
the normal map is not taken into account. Make sure you have large enough UV borders otherwise wrong content might creep in.
