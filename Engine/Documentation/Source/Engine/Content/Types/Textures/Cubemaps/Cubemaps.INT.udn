Description:The landing page for cubemaps: creation, export, import, and usage within Unreal Engine 4.


Cubemaps provide a simple method of environment mapping, in which distant scenery - such as skies and surrounding environments - is mapped to a panoramic texture. Under the hood, these textures are stored as a series of six images mapped to the inside faces of a cube.
