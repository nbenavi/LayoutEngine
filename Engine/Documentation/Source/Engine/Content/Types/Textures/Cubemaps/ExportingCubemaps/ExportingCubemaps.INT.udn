## Overview

This document goes over how to export cubemaps out of Photoshop using the NVIDIA Texture Tools plug-in.

## Exporting Cubemaps (Photoshop)

Once you have a series of images laid out in Photoshop and ready to use as a cubemap, then you are ready for export. In this example, we will use the NVIDIA Texture Tools plug-in for Photoshop CS6.

If you have not yet installed this plug-in, you can get it [here](http://developer.nvidia.com/content/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop).

1. First, make sure your textures for the cubemap are lined up in a single document, and that they are all the same size. This size should also be a power of 2. Be sure that the frames are rotated as described [here](Engine/Content/Types/Textures/Cubemaps/CreatingCubemaps).
