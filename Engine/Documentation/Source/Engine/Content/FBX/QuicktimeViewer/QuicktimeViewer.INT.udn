## Overview


Viewing FBX files often involved importing it into your favorite 3D content creation package and then viewing it from there. However, this can be tricky if you normally do not work with 3D models (that is, if you are mostly a programmer). Fortunately, Autodesk has made a plug-in for QuickTime which allows you to view FBX files without having those 3D content creation packages installed. 


## Downloading the plug-in and QuickTime

You can download the latest plug-in from [Autodesk's website](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?siteID=123112&id=22694824). The plug-in is available for both Windows and Mac.

If you do not have QuickTime installed, then you will need to download it from [Apple's website](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/) and then install it. 


## Opening the FBX file

The plug-in does not add an extension to the list of files that QuickTime can view. To bypass this, select the "All Files(<literal>*.*</literal>)" option. Your FBX files should then appear, then **double-click** your FBX file or select your FBX file and then press Open.

## Playing back animations

Viewing FBX files within QuickTime also allows you to play back animations by either scrubbing the timeline or by pressing the Play button.

## Other controls

More control information can be found within the plug-in's read me. However some will be listed here for your convenience.
