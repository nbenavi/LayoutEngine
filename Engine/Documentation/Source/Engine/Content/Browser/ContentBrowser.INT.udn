## Overview

[EXCERPT:Intro]
[INCLUDE:Shared/Glossary/C/#Glossary_Content_Browser]

[/EXCERPT:Intro]

In the **Content Browser**, you can:

* Browse to and interact with all assets found in the game.
* Find assets, whether saved or unsaved:
    * Text Filter: In the **Search Assets** box, type text to find assets by Name, Path, Tags, or Type. You can exclude assets from your search by prefixing a search token with a '-'.
    * Extended Filter: Click the **Filters** button to filter by asset type(s) and other criteria.
* Organize assets without ever needing to check out packages from source control:
    * Create Local or Private Collections and store assets in them for future use.
    * Create Shared Collections to share interesting assets with your coworkers.
* Get development assistance:
    * Show assets that may contain problems.
* Use the **Migrate** tool to move assets and all their dependent assets to other content folders automatically.


## Accessing the Content Browser

The **Content Browser** is accessible from the **Window** menu. You can open up to four concurrent instances of the **Content Browser** at a time. This is useful in a variety of ways, such as:

* Having different asset types filtered in different **Content Browsers**, such as one that just shows Static Meshes and another that just shows Materials.
* Moving assets between different folders where you would like to see the other assets available in the folders.


[REGION:caption]
	By default, the **Content Browser** is docked in the lower left corner of the main Level Editor interface, but it can be re-docked anywhere within the Level Editor or floated as its own window.
