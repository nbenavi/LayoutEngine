For more information about the **Content Browser**, see [](Engine/Content/Browser).


## Search Options

In the upper-left corner of the Reference Viewer, you can see two options related to the search used by the Unreal Editor to build the graph.

![Search Options](CB_RefViewer2.png)


| Item | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Search Depth Limit** | The depth to which the engine will search for references. For example, a value of 2 means that the graph will display not only the assets related to the selected asset, but also the assets that are related to those related assets. |
| **Search Breadth Limit** | The number of references listed in a given column (reference or referenced by). For example, if an asset references 20 assets, but the value of the **Search Breadth Limit** is set to 10, only 10 assets will be displayed in that column. |


## Context Menu Options

To view options for an asset in the graph, **right-click** the asset.  A context menu will appear.

| Item | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Find in Content Browser** | Finds the selected asset in the **Content Browser**. |
| **Re-Center Graph** | Recreates the graph around the selected asset, with assets it references and is referenced by. |
| **List Referenced Objects** | Displays a list of assets referenced by the selected asset. |
| **List Objects That Reference** | Displays a list of assets that reference the selected asset. |
| **Make Collection With Referenced Assets** | Creates a Collection with the assets that reference and are referenced by the selected asset. |
| **Show Reference Tree** | Displays a Reference Tree for the selected asset. Note that depending on the complexity of your game, this may take some time. For more information about the Reference Tree, see [](Engine/Content/Browser\ReferenceTreeTool).|
