## Overview

![CB_Collections.png](CB_Collections.png)

[EXCERPT:Collections]
Collections serve as a way to organize sets of assets into personally defined groups, like folders. For instance, you may find it useful to create a Collection of all environment-based Static Meshes that fit a certain visual style, for quick access later. 

Under the hood, Collections are really just lists of references to given assets. The assets themselves are not moved into the Collection. This means that a single asset can exist in any number of Collections, and you can create as many Collections as you wish.

[REGION:note]
	**Note**: The Collections panel may not be available by default. To open the Collections panel, simply open the **View Options** drop down menu, then click on **Show Collections**.

## Creating Collections

To create your first Collection **left-click** on the add Collection icon in the top right corner of the Collections panel and name.

After your first Collection has been created, additional Collections are as easy as **right-clicking** within the **Collections** panel and entering a name for the new Collection.

## Collection Types

Collections can come in three different types, as defined by the small letter to the right of their name.

* **L** - Local Collection; these Collections are available only on your local machine.
* **S** - Shared Collection; these Collections are visible to other users.
* **P** - Private Collection; these Collections are available only to those that have been specifically invited to view the Collection.

[REGION:note]
	**Shared** and **Private** Collections are available only if Source Control is active under the main Editor [preferences](Engine/UI/EditorSettings).

## Adding Asset References to Collections

To add an asset reference to a Collection, just drag the asset into the given Collection.

## Removing Asset References from Collections

Removing asset references simply requires that you **right-click** on one or more selected assets and choose **Remove from Collection** from the context menu. This does not delete the asset; it only removes the reference to that asset from the Collection.

[REGION:warning]
If you select an asset in a Collection and press **Delete**, you _can_ delete the asset entirely. You will get a prompt verifying that this is what you want to do, but keep in mind that _deleting_ an asset means it is _destroyed_. If you simply want the asset reference out of the Collection, use the method described above.

## Renaming and Destroying Collections

A Collection can be renamed by **right-clicking** on the given Collection and choosing **Rename**. Just enter the new name you are set to go.

To delete a Collection, just choose **Delete** from the **right-click** menu. Note that since Collections are just references to the actual assets, deleting your Collections will not delete the assets within the Collection.
