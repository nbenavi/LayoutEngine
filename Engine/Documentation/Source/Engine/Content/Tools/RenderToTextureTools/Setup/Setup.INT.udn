Title:Render to Texture Toolset Setup
Crumbs:%ROOT%, Engine, Engine/Content
Description:

The RenderToTexture Blueprint works by using a bare-bones **GameMode** setup. There is a companion asset called the **RenderToTexture_Game** which references the **RenderToTexture_Pawn**.  The Pawn is a very basic blueprint that simply has a **Camera Component** set to orthographic and a few event graph nodes to setup the rendering console commands. 

The basic setup for using the Render to Texture tools is as follows:

1. Create a new blank level.
1. Place a **Player Start** from the **Modes** panel, **Basic** category, at location 0,0,0. Make sure the rotation on the **Player Start** is set to 0,0,0.

1. In the **Content Browser** **View Options**, enable **Show Engine Content**.

1. Browse to **Engine** -> **ArtTools** -> **RenderToTexture** -> **Blueprints** in the **Content Browser**. 
1. Place a **RenderToTexture_LevelBP** Blueprint at location 0,0,0 in the world

1. Click the **World Settings** button. The **World Settings** panel will open where the **Details** panel is docked (by default).

1. Assign the **RenderToTexture_GameMode** Blueprint (found in RenderToTexture/Blueprints/) as the **GameMode** in the **World Settings**

1. Leave the **High Resolution Screenshot** dialog open.
1. Adjust the **New Window Size** property in **Editor** -> **Preferences** -> **Play** to a size that is a power of 2. A size of 512x512 is suggested and will not affect the quality of the output images.

The setting to choose which type of basic function will be performed is located under the **Default** category:

Below this you will find categories that correspond to the values in the **Render Type** property.

The only Property category besides Default that is relevant to all functions is the **Capture Settings** category. This category enables you to select which buffer targets you wish to save. For most cases, **Base Color** and **Normal** are sufficient. To render out opacity masks the **Decal Mask** option works well.

The resolution multiplier will multiply the settings you entered into the **New Window Size** in the Editor Preferences. So if you entered 512x512, a multiplier of 2 would result in a 1024x1024 texture size. A multiplier of 4 would result in a 2048x2048 texture size. Depending on the desired results, you may want to render textures as high as 4096 or 8192 in order to down-sample them in Adobe Photoshop. In those cases, it is usually suggested that you add a post process volume and set the Anti Aliasing setting to "none" to get a more crisp result. 

 This method currently saves `.bmp` format images. It is currently necessary to open and resave as `.tga` using an image processing tool. In practice, that is not a big deal since in most cases you will want to render at a large res and down-sample using an image processing pass later.

 Finally, you can add a light to the scene if you like, it has no effect on the visualization buffers that are rendered out.
